This is the README file for the XmlRpcClient application as part of
version 1.0 of the Jala Javascript Library.


About XmlRpcClient
------------------

The XmlRpcClient is a small Helma application useful to test and debug XmlRpc
requests.


Installation
------------

To install the application add the following to the apps.properties file in
your Helma installation directory:

xmlrpcclient
xmlrpcclient.repository.0 = ./modules/jala/util/XmlRpcClient


Usage Instructions
------------------

To access the XmlRpcClient point your browser to the URL

http://your.server.domain[:port]/xmlrpcclient

(replace "your.server.domain" with the domain of your server, and the ":port"
section with the port number if not 80). Then fill out the form with at least
the URL of the XmlRpc service and the method name (both are required).

Optionally you can pass various arguments to the remote method using standard
Javascript literal notation, eg.:

String: 	"a string"
Number: 	1
Boolean:	true|false
Objec: 	{name: "jala"}
Array: 	[1, 2, "three", 4]
Date: 	new Date(2007, 0, 22, 15, 10)

By default the XmlRpc client uses UTF-8 as encoding for request and response,
which you can change to ISO-8859-1 if necessary. If you select the "Show Xml"
checkbox the result shown will also contain the Xml source of the request and
response, which is useful for debugging.

At last you can tell the client to use a specific HTTP proxy for the requests,
which you must define in the form "fqdn:port", eg. "my.proxy.com:3128".
